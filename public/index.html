          <h3>Bubble Sort Method</h3>
          <p>
            Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple
            sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares
            adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The
            pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The
            algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller
            or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
            <br />
            <br />
            This simple algorithm performs poorly in real world use and is used
            primarily as an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as
            quicksort, timesort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries
            built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.

        <h3>Insertion Sort Method</h3>
        <p>
          Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similarly to
          the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually
          split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted
          part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
          <br />
          <br />
          Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition,
          and grows a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort
          removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs
          within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no
          input elements remain.

        <h3>Merge Sort Method</h3>
        <p>
          Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on the idea of
          breaking down a list into several sub-lists until each sublist
          consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner
          that results into a sorted list.
          <br />
          <br />
          While comparing two sublists for merging, the first element of both
          lists is taken into consideration. While sorting in ascending order,
          the element that is of a lesser value becomes a new element of the
          sorted list. This procedure is repeated until both the smaller
          sublists are empty and the new combined sublist comprises all the
          elements of both the sublists.

        <h3>Quicksort Sort Method</h3>
        <p>
          Quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm. Developed by British
          computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, it is
          still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it
          can be somewhat faster than merge sort and about two or three times
          faster than heapsort.
          <br />
          <br />
          Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a
          'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements
          into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or
          greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called
          partition-exchange sort. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
          This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of
          memory to perform the sorting.

        <h3>Selection Sort Method</h3>
        <p>
          In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting
          algorithm. It has an O(n2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient
          on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar
          insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has
          performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain
          situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.
          <br />
          <br />
          The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist
          of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of
          the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the
          rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the
          unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by
          finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element
          in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost
          unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist
          boundaries one element to the right.
