## Description

This web application was created to help users visualize the various differences between common sorting algortithms. Users can adjust the size of the array, the speed the algorithm sorts the array, and the particular algorithm they would like to visualize. Each visualization is designed to help users understand the differences between bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, and merge sort. After the visualization is complete, users can select a new sorting algorithm, generate a new array, or read a small description outlining the current sorting algorithm.
